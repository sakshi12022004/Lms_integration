/**
 * Student Onboarding Agent (bulk Excel student import) + Step 11 password setup.
 * Mounted in server.js:
 *   /api/onboarding     behind authMiddleware + requireTenant; the router itself enforces
 *                       admin-only, re-checks the admin against the DB, and keeps each
 *                       school's import jobs private.
 *   /api/student-setup  public, rate-limited: a student sets their own password with the
 *                       one-time link emailed after the import.
 * errorHandler is mounted after both so upstream errors on these paths (e.g. malformed
 * JSON rejected by the global body parser) get safe JSON responses.
 * All logic lives in ai-modules/student-onboarding-agent.
