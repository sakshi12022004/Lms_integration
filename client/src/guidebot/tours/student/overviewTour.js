// Student "Dashboard + Courses + Course detail + Results + Attendance"
// walkthrough — deterministic, configuration-driven. One continuous GuideBot
// session. A / B / C / D are sidebar-tab introductions: GuideBot opens the tab
// first (autoNavigate — the app's own sidebar link), waits for the page and
// target to render, and only then highlights the tab. A1.., B1.., C1.., D1
// explain that page's contents.
//
// Purely descriptive and non-interactive: the only things GuideBot ever
// clicks are the app's own sidebar tabs, the real "Continue" link of the
// first course (to open that course by its real id), and the first week's
// own expand header (to reveal its materials). It never calls an API and
// never invents data: steps whose target depends on real data (an enrolled
// course, a material, a result...) are skipped when that data isn't there
// (`skipIfMissing`), and dropped from the progress total.
//
// Interaction is blocked by default (`disableActiveInteraction` below); a
// step that genuinely needs the user to act would opt in with
//   driverStepConfig: { disableActiveInteraction: false }
